##What is Graph?
Graph is a structure made of vertices and edges.
Graph is a structure amounting to a set of objects in which some pairs of the objects are in some sense "related". 
The objects correspond to mathematical abstractions called vertices (also called nodes or points) and each of the related pairs of vertices is called an edge (also called link or line).

##Graph Representation
A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. 
The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.

##Graph Components
**Nodes:** These are the most important components in any graph. Nodes are entities whose relationships are expressed using edges. If a graph comprises 2 nodes A and B and an undirected edge between them, then it expresses a bi-directional relationship between the nodes and edge.

**Edges:** Edges are the components that are used to represent the relationships between various nodes in a graph. An edge between two nodes expresses a one-way or two-way relationship between the nodes.

##Graph Structure
**Vertex** − Each node of the graph is represented as a vertex. In the following example, the labeled circle represents vertices.

**Edge** − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices.

**Adjacency** − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge.

**Path** − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices.

##Types of Graphs
1. **Weighted Graph**
   Graphs whose edges or paths have values. All the values seen associated with the edges are called weights. Edges value can represent weight/cost/length.


2. **Unweighted Graph**
   Where there is no value or weight associated with the edge. By default, all the graphs are unweighted unless there is a value associated.


3. **Undirected Graph**
   Where a set of objects are connected, and all the edges are bidirectional. The below image showcases the undirected graph,


4. **Directed Graph**
   It is also called a digraph, where a set of objects (N, E) are connected, and all the edges are directed from one node to another. The above image showcases the directed graph.
